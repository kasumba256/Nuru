            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Humanity cannot stand without humanity. Back in 2015, the Lord laid a burden in the heart of his servant Ikiba Rudin Santos, who is the director of Hope for Africa Nuru Slums, to reach out to the Orphans and the less fortunate with a message of hope and encouragement. The man of God found at that there was more needs for the people even as he shared the good news of Hope; he was surrounded by hungry children and families that were living in abject poverty.</p>
             

            <p>As a survivor of war and an Orphan and having grown up in a slum, the servant of God understood what it means to sleep on a hungry stomach, go without clothes and shelter, lack medication. The Servant of God could identify with the needs of the Children and people he ministered to and as a student of the Bible, he kept sharing the little that he had in terms of food and other supplies. (Proverbs 3:27-28). He knew that the Lord was not asking of what he does not have but as He asked Moses, “What do you have in your hand” Ikiba knew that God would use the little he had to create lasting impacts.</p>
            
            <p>As a footballer, the man of God would share messages of hope and encourage youths from the slums to play football as part of activities to keep them busy and reduce crime in the slums. </p>
            
           
            <p>Ikiba was adopted by a lovely mother “Judith Martha Rudin”, and he always shared with her his passion every time Judith would ask him what he would love to do. The answer was always the same, to give a child hope and impact their life in order to become self reliant in the society. Over the years, Judith’s interest with Ikiba’s vision grew and she began sharing the same burden and together they started supporting few orphans to which led Ikiba to start living with them. The man of God has since supported approximately 300 children through school providing General basic need, and is currently living with 8 of them in his home and supporting other children in through them living with different families in Kenya. The organization envisages a home for all and to build a school to facilitate basic education of the less fortunate children in the near future so that they can live together.</p>
            <h2>About us </h2>
            <p>
                Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to act. Do not say to your neighbor, "Come back tomorrow and I’ll give it to you"—when you already have it with you. — Proverbs 3:27-28
                
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do away with the yoke of oppression, with the pointing finger and malicious talk, and if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, then your light will rise in the darkness, and your night will become like the noonday. The Lord will guide you always; he will satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched land and will strengthen your frame. You will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters never fail. — Isaiah 58:6-11
            </p>
            <p>
                Hope for Africa Nuru Slums believes in Christian values of sharing. We believe in touching lives in small ways but making lasting impacts. We believe in changing the lives around us one at a time as God helps us.
